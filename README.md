# Twitter_sentiment
**Version 1.0.0** <br /> 
This is  twiiter sentiment analysis project.Here i have taken tweets related to corna virus and analyzed them first using text blob. <br /> 
Then i have created my own model as according to textblob a tweet with:<br /> 
"I have been tested postive for corona"<br /> 
is a neutral tweet.<br /> 
Well it is not moreover it is a negative tweet.<br /> 
## Installation
I have used anconda,collab and jupyter notebook so if you are using anaconad ypu need to install the following
First I have created a enivorment in anaconda as i as using Python 3.8 and tensor flow supports in 3.7 and 
below in anaconda
So open the anaconda and runn the following command
```bash
   conda create -n myenv python=3.5 
```
This creates a python environement named myenv  with version of python 3.5 <br /> 
Packages to be installed:-
```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge tweepy
   conda install -c anaconda pandas
   conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud
   conda install -c anaconda numpy
   conda install -c anaconda regex
   conda install -c conda-forge textblob
   conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
```
These packages are used to analysis using textblob.<br />
To do the sentiment analysis using my model I suggest you to use Collab<br />
Packages for model:
```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge spacy
   conda install -c anaconda tensorflow
   conda install -c conda-forge spacy-model-en_core_web_sm
```
I am assuming you have also installled packages from list-1<br />
You also need twiiters api for downloading the tweets for that you need to create<br />
a twiiter's developer account <br />
You can follow the video in link below to get your api: <br />

## Working
**Basic using textblob**<br />
I have created three different notebooks in this project first  i have done the analysis using textblob which is pretty simple and easy you just need basic 
knowledge on how to use panda,textblob and matplot.lib <br />
**About the model that i created**<br />
Now for the model I have first downloaded tweets using tweepy and save them in csv file<br /> 
And i have manually given sentiment to these 200 tweets by reading them<br />
0 is a negative tweet and 1 is a positive tweet<br />
  **Data Cleaning**<br />
Later on after saving and editing them I have applied data cleaning <br />
I have removed stopwords and punctiouns using spacy and used my custom<br />
data cleaning function to remove #,@,emojis,Urls etc<br/>
  **Tokenizing**<br />
I have tokenized them using tokenizer and added padding to them<br />
So that they have equal length <br />
  **Word2vec**<br />
Now i have used the conccept of vectorization for word embedings<br />
I have taken glove file which is availabe on Kaggle as dictionary<br />
Using this file i have created vectors for differnt words and embeded them<br />
 **About the model**<br />
 I have used 4 layers in my nerual network model.First I have used <br />
 a basic nembeding layer that i made using word2vec after that I have used <br />
 GlobalMAxpool1D and 2 dense layer with differnet activation one with relu and <br />
 other with sigmod
```
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, 100),
   
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```
 **Accuracy**
 The model gave an accuracy of 92% over training and 88% on testing 
 ```
 history = model.fit(ctweets_test, sentiments_test, epochs=20, validation_data=(ctweets_test, sentiments_test), verbose=1)
